'''Command line arguments are usually separated by spaces, but in
this case, you want to interpret all of the arguments as a single string. Since
sys.argv is a list of strings, you can pass it to the join() method, which returns
a single string value. You donâ€™t want the program name in this string, so
instead of sys.argv, you should pass sys.argv[1:] to chop off the first element
of the array. The final string that this expression evaluates to is stored in
the address variable.'''
